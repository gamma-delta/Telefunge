TELEFUNGE

Concepts:
2-D grid on which a turtle crawls. Starts at the first @ symbol (or 0,0 if there isn't one)
Each tick, the turtle moves forward, then executes the action it is standing on.
If the turtle goes outside the grid, it wraps around.
The turtle has a stack of ints. It is pretty deep (1000).
There is also an auxillary stack, same as the turtle but it doesn't move. It is more limited.
They are both initialized to a lot of 0s.

Instuctions:
@ Start position. If there are multiples the program explodes.
. End program

^ Turn up
> Turn right
V Turn down
< Turn left
| If first slot in turtle stack != 0, go up; else go down
_ If first slot in turtle stack != 0, go left; else go right
? Turn random

# Start/stop pushing hex numbers to turtle stack (0-F -> 0-15)
" Start/stop pushing ASCII text to turtle stack. Will format stuff like \n, but you can't do like \\n to get \n.
: Pop and display ASCII from turtle
; Pop and display number from turtle

+ Pop a,b from turtle; push a+b
- Pop a,b; push a-b
* Pop a,b; push a*b
/ Pop a,b; push a/b (floored)
% Pop a,b; push a%b (mod)
R Raise front of turtle stack by 1
L Lower front of turtle stack by 1

P Pop turtle stack
p Pop aux stack
S Pop from turtle and push to aux
s Pop from aux and push to turtle
C Copy from turtle and push to aux
c Copy from aux and push to turtle
W Swap turtle and aux fronts

T Pop a,b from turtle; teleport to those coords (a,b). If it overflows, modulus by grid size.
t Pop a,b from aux; teleport to those coords. See above.

X Turn on hexadecimal display (default)
x Turn off hexadecimal display

Everything else is ignored.
